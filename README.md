# this code was design to encrypt texts using Caesar's cipher also know as Caesar’s cipher, the shift cipher, Caesar’s code.
The code seeks to perform the encryption by:

>First converting element in the text to their respective ascii character codes
ascii character code for letters in lowercase range from 097 - 122 whilst uppercase case ranges form 065 - 090
>we then shifted to the specified position given as argument to the method whilst considering the range of both lowercase and uppercase
>we only shift if the if it is an alphabet we do not add(shift) if the char code value does not fall between the range of either being a lowercase or uppercase letter
>convert the char code from ascii to letter of the aphabet after shifting
